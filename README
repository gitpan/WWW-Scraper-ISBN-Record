WWW/Scraper/ISBN/Record version 0.16
====================================

WWW::Scraper::ISBN::Record - Book Record class for WWW::Scraper::ISBN module.

The WWW::Scraper::ISBN::Record module defines a class that can be used to deal with book information.  It was primarily
created as a return type for the WWW::Scraper::ISBN module, though it could be used for other purposes.  It knows minimal
information about itself, whether the book was found, where it was found, its ISBN number, and whether any errors occurred.
It is usually up to the WWW::Scraper::ISBN::Driver and its subclasses to make sure that the fields get set correctly.
