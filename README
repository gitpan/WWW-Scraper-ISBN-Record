DESCRIPTION

WWW::Scraper::ISBN::Record - Book Record class for WWW::Scraper::ISBN module.

The WWW::Scraper::ISBN::Record module defines a class that can be used to deal 
with book information. It was primarily created as a return type for the 
WWW::Scraper::ISBN module, though it could be used for other purposes. It 
knows minimal information about itself, whether the book was found, where it 
was found, its ISBN number, and whether any errors occurred. It is usually up
to the WWW::Scraper::ISBN::Driver and its subclasses to make sure that the 
fields get set correctly.
